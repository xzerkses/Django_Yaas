# Complete Project or Leftovers requirements

If you have chosen option 2 or 3, then you can submit your entire project here for grading. On the other hand, if you have chosen option 1 and submitted your project in 3 incremental parts, then you have a chance to implement those requirements which have not been graded yet in the last three assignments and submitted here.

Submission guidelines:

- Please read and understand the full description of each requirement from the [Project Specifications](https://moodle.abo.fi/mod/resource/view.php?id=54968) document on the moodle.
- Please make sure you have mentioned all the implemented requirements in the project report for this assignment and in the previous assignments. The lecturers will only check and give grades for those requirements which are listed in the project report.
- Each requirement will be checked and graded ONLY once. Therefore, you should put only those requirements in the project report which are fully working otherwise you will lose the points for those requirements. 
- Commit the source code of your Django project in the **source** folder and the project report in the **report** folder of your Github repository.
- Please make sure you have read and followed the instructions for the source code and report correctly, otherwise the examiners may deduct the points.
- Submit in moodle the link to the GITHUB.COM repository of your assignment and the link to your deployed web application at PythonAnywhere.com

Please observe that github.com may not show the lecturers the commits done after the deadline.

Guidelines on how to use GIT and github.com can be found in [here](https://moodle.abo.fi/mod/page/view.php?id=207522).
