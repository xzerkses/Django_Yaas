You must create a report where you describe clearly and concisely the following information about your project (where applicable based on the implemented project requirements):

1. Donâ€™t forget to put your full name and student number.
2. List of implemented requirements in the project report for this assignment and in the previous assignments. Only the requirements in the list will be graded. Do not forget to include which optional features you implemented and how.
3. List of Python packages used beside django and their version (should be identical to the one in  requirement.txt in the project source folder)
4. Mention the admin username and password for your DB.
5. How does your application implement session management.
6. How do you implement the confirmation form in UC3.
7. UC8 Resolving bids must be initiated automatically (and not by a user). How do you initiate this?
8. How do you avoid possible concurrency problems, specially in UC6?
9. Present the REST API for your service. Is your service RESTful? What resources do you expose over the API and what is the URI to access them. Include concrete examples of HTTP requests and responses for bidding in an auction.
10. A description of your functional tests, what are you testing and why.
11. How have you implemented the language switching mechanism?
12. Specify the location data generation program and how it can be used (invoked)
